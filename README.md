Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning 📖 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical problem for organizations as it leads to increased hiring costs and productivity loss. This project aims to analyze employee data and build a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not. The project includes data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using Python and machine learning techniques.
